// couple of percent taller than the box itself, overflowing past its
// bottom edge. Content that overflows past the clipped box's edge can
// never be revealed by inset() (it has no "bottom: negative" to extend
// into), so those descender tips stayed permanently unfilled no matter

/**
 * Landing-page-only splash: a plain beige cover (same `bg-bg` as the page
 * itself) with a big centered "ReplyMind" wordmark that fills from the
 * bottom up like water rising in a glass, in sync with actual page load.
 * It only lives on the homepage (mounted from `app/page.tsx`, not the root
 * layout) because its whole job is to mask the landing page's own content
 * settling (fonts, Hero's layout measurements, etc.); other pages don't
 * need it.
 *
 * Sequence: the fill rises over FILL_DURATION_MS starting at mount → once
 * full *and* the page is actually ready, hold briefly so the full fill
 * registers → then the whole cover slides up and away, revealing the
 * landing page underneath. The slide never starts before the fill is full.
